Reading list for Fertility Heterogeneity week is available under
materials tab. Most of this material is optional, for after-class
reading. If you are familiar with Bongaarts-Feeney tempo adjustment,
would recommend looking at the Burkimsher paper. If you're not
familiar with B-F, the review paper by me and Tom provides a
moderately technical overview. We'll be doing section 2.5 in class.

Ken also sent an updated version of his slides, which I've posted.
