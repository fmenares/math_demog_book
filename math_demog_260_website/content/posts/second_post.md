I've just posted a corrected version of Lecture 3. This includes a
reconciliation with the result on mortality progress over time. (The
problem turned out to be in part that the Vaupel and Missov derivation
has a mistaken minus sign in one of the definitions.)

I've also posted a pdf of the Manton and Stollard reading on
Black/White crossover.
