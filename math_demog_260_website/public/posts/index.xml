      <description>Reading list for Fertility Heterogeneity week is available under materials tab. Most of this material is optional, for after-class reading. If you are familiar with Bongaarts-Feeney tempo adjustment, would recommend looking at the Burkimsher paper. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with B-F, the review paper by me and Tom provides a moderately technical overview. We&amp;rsquo;ll be doing section 2.5 in class.
Ken also sent an updated version of his slides, which I&amp;rsquo;ve posted.</description>

      <description>The Waldron analysis presents the following table.
  If we simulate two heterogeneous groups, one which always has twice the baseline mortality level as the other, then we will see the observed hazard ratio converge with age as mortality selectively removes the most frail individuals. If we let the baseline levels of both groups decline steadily, simulating the process of mortality improvement, then this will make it appar that the hazard ratio is rising over time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just posted a corrected version of Lecture 3. This includes a reconciliation with the result on mortality progress over time. (The problem turned out to be in part that the Vaupel and Missov derivation has a mistaken minus sign in one of the definitions.)
I&amp;rsquo;ve also posted a pdf of the Manton and Stollard reading on Black/White crossover.</description>
