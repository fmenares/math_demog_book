# Branching Processes 

## Outline 
  
  - The Galton-Watson-Bienaym\'e Process
  - A viral example, simulating a branching process, our questionsThe distribution of the 2nd generation
  - Moment generating functions
  - Extinction probabilities
  - The distribution of offspring of all generations
  - A tractable offspring distribution
  
## Motivation

- Until now, we've focused on the hidden structures of
    heterogeneity.
- Now, we're switching gears:
  - Stochastic not deterministic
  - In small populations, randomness matters. (Even when risks are homogeneous.)
  - branching processes ("parents producing children"), next
      Fisher-Wright ("children choosing parents"), and then historical
      reconstruction from contemporary diversity ("coalescent").

### Very brief history of Branching Processes
  
  - Bienayme's lost notes
  - Galton  and Watson's (extinction of families)
    old motivation: to see if elites were dying out because of
  "degeneration"
  - Genetics (survival of a mutant)
    - contemporary motivation: evolution and neutral genetic
  change. what is the chance that a mutant will survive?
  - The bomb (chain reactions)
    - war-time motivation: to see how to build the bomb
  - Anywhere "incipient dynamics" matter.
    - sociological: will all of S. Korea be "Kim"?
  - can we get variance of repro success from name disn?
  - it will give us a headstart on other (less realistic but easier) "drift" models.
  
### Applicability to the Coronavirus? Yes and no.

  - Perhaps the beginning, with first few cases.
  - But once scale gets large, we'll see that deterministic
    dynamics take over.
  - One lesson: beyond $R_0$.
  
## Simulated examples and the questions they raise

### Our viral example
  Here are the chances that the first carrier passes on the virus to $k$
  people?

| $k$| $p_k$| digits|

+----+------+-------+
| 1  | .4   | 3-5   |

  - What is $R_0$, (aka $m$)? Calculate.
  - Let's diagram one chance outcome, using my number "(xxx) xxx-9056"

## What is a (Bienaym\'e-)Galton-Watson branching process?

  - $p_k$: Each individual in each generation reproduces
    independently, following same offspring distribution, with $p_k$
    as the probability of having $k$ offspring.
  - $Z_n$: The si$Z$e of the $n$'th generation $Z_n$. ($Z_1 \equiv 1$)
  - $p_0 > 0$: Some non-zero probability of no children.
  - Variance: None of the $p_k$ are 1


Some questions

![Galton's original question](/hdir/0/fmenares/Book/bookdown-master/images/galton.png)

  
  - What is the chance $d$ of eventual extinction (no "outbreak")?
  -  Or, what is the distribution of surviving family
    sizes?
  - What are the aggregate properties of many branching
    processes? (Mean growth, variance, time-paths, eventual size)?
  
## Simulations 
  
```{r} 
  k = 0:2
  p0 = .3; p1 = .3; p2 = .4;
  p_k = c(p0, p1, p2)
  Z1 = 1
  set.seed(9)
  (kids.of.Z1 = sample(x = k, size = Z1, replace = T, prob = p_k))
  (Z2 = sum(kids.of.Z1))
  (kids.of.Z2 = sample(x = k, size = Z2, replace = T, prob = p_k))
  (Z3 = sum(kids.of.Z2))
  (kids.of.Z3 = sample(x = k, size = Z3, replace = T, prob = p_k))
  (Z4 = sum(kids.of.Z3))
```
  Let's draw the tree.

  /\
 /\/\
/\/ /\

```{r}
  #A function   
  branch <- function(n_max = 30, pk = c(p0, p1, p2), Z1 = 1)
  {
      Z.vec <- rep(NA, n_max)
      Z.vec[1] <- Z1
      for (i in 1:(n_max-1))
      {
          Z.vec[i+1] <- sum(sample(x = k,
                                   size = Z.vec[i],
                                   replace = T,
                                   prob = p_k))
      }
      return(Z.vec)
  }
  set.seed(19); branch()
  set.seed(99);  branch()
```

  Let's see what happens with 20 trials (up to 30 generations)

```{r, fig.height = 5}
  n_trials = 20; n_gen = 30
  Z.mat <- matrix(NA, n_trials, n_gen)
  set.seed(131) 
  for (i in 1:n_trials)
      Z.mat[i,] <- branch(n_max = n_gen)
  matplot(t(Z.mat),
          type = "l", lty = 1, ylab = "Zn", xlab = "n")
```
  
How many survive (out of 20)?


log-scale
```{r, fig.height = 4}
  suppressWarnings(matplot(t(Z.mat), log = "y", type = "l", lty = 1, ylab = "Zn", xlab = "n"))
  surviving = ifelse(Z.mat[,n_gen] == 0, "extinct", "survive")
  foo <- prop.table(table(surviving))

  print( prop.table(table(surviving)) )
```
  
How would you discribe the time path of the surviving lines?

Long term
```{r, fig.height = 4}
  n_trials = 20; n_gen = 100
  Z.mat <- matrix(NA, n_trials, n_gen)
  set.seed(131) 
  for (i in 1:n_trials)
      Z.mat[i,] <- branch(n_max = n_gen)
  suppressWarnings(matplot(t(Z.mat), log = "y", type = "l", lty = 1, ylab = "Zn", xlab = "n"))
```

What does this remind you of? (Hint: "Leslie"). (See Harris figure)


## "Extinction" vs "breakout"
  
  - We see that in a super-critical ($m > 1$) branching process,
    if a line can survive a few generations and reach a large enough
    size, it will grow exponentially.
  - What happens if $m < 1$, if $m = 1$? Discuss.
  

### The Probability Generating Function: Our mathematical tool

  $$
  h(z) = p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2 + \ldots
  $$

  The PGF "keeps book" on the probabilities. The
  chance of $k$ is the coefficient on $z^k$.


  -$h(0) = $ 
  -$h(1) = $ 
  -$h'(1) = $

The story of two brothers

  A father has two sons. The probability generating function of their
  children combined is:

  $$
  [h(z)]^2 = (p_0  + p_1 z + p_2 z^2) \times (p_0  + p_1 z + p_2 z^2)
  $$

  Multiply out, and tell me the coefficients on $z^0, z^1, \ldots $.

What is the probability generating function for the distribution of grandsons?

  
  - A man has two sons, with probability $p_2$, so PGF in that case
    is $  p_2 [h(z)]^2 $.
  - But let's sum over all possible numbers of
    sons.

    $$
    p_0 + p_1 h(z) + p_2 [h(z)]^2 + p_3 [h(z)]^3 + \ldots
    $$

  - Which is? (Hint: write a new argument for PGF) 
    $$
    h(h(z))
    $$

  - Can show PGF for the n'th generation is
    $$
    h(h(h ... \mbox{$n$ times}  h(z)))  = h_n(z)
    $$

exercise: write out $h_2(z) = h(h(z))$ for 
  $$
  h(z) =     p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2.
  $$}


- Extinction
  -"Extinction is forever.": So, the probability $d_n$ of extinction
    {\em by } generation $n$ can never decline over time. (Must it
    always rise?)

- Recursive extinction
  -Is non-extinction "forever"?: If $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} = d(\infty) <
    1$, then this says there's a chance $1 - d(\infty)$ of eternal
    persistence. We'll try to figure out more about what this means.
  
  If the probability of a female line going extinct in $n$ generations
  is $d_n$, then this is equivalent to her daughter(s) line(s) going
  extinct in $n-1$ generations. With $p_k$ chance of having
  $k$ daughters, we have
  $$
  d_n = p_0 + p_1 d_{n-1} + \mbox{What is next term in series?}
  $$


  What can we do with 
  $$
  d_n = h(d_{n-1})?
  $$ 
  
  Well, remember that $d_n$ is non-decreasing, and that it's maximum
  can be no greater than $1.0$. When $d_n$ reaches it's limit, say
  $d$,  we won't need generational subscripts, $d$ will be constant,
  and will obey
  $$
  d = h(d)
  $$

  Thus, an amazing result: the probability of ultimate extinction
  is when the argument equals the PGF of the argument.

Can $d = 1$, can $d < 1$
  
  
  - Try $d = 1$. What happens?
  - If we were to find a solution less than 1.0, how would we
    interpret that?
  


Three cases

```{r, fig.height = 7}
  par(mfrow = c(1,3), pty = "s")
  z = seq(0, 1.6, .01)
  pk = c(.3, .0, .7); names(pk) <- 0:2
  d <- pk["0"]
  for (i in 1:10)
  {
      d <- pk["0"]  + pk["1"]*d + pk["2"]*d^2
  }
  ##  super-critical 
  hz = pk["0"]  + pk["1"]*z + pk["2"]*z^2
  plot.fun <- function(z, hz)
  {
      plot(z, hz, type = "l", ylim = c(0,1.6),
           ylab = "h(z)",
           yaxs = "i", xaxs = "i", axes = F)
      axis(1, at = seq(0, 1.5, .5))
      axis(2, at = seq(0, 1.5, .5))
      abline(0,1, col = "grey")
      lines(z, hz)
      axis(2, at = pk["0"], labels = "p0",
           col.axis = "red", col = "red",
           lwd = 1, las = 2)
  }
  plot.fun(z,hz)
  points(c(d, 1),c(d, 1))
  title("Super-critical (m > 1) \n 2 roots")
  ## sub-critical
  pk = c(.3, .55, .15); names(pk) <- 0:2
  hz = pk["0"]  + pk["1"]*z + pk["2"]*z^2
  plot.fun(z,hz)
  title("Sub-critical (m < 1) \n 1 root")
  points(1,1)
  ## critical
  pk = c(.3, .4, .3); names(pk) <- 0:2
  hz = pk["0"]  + pk["1"]*z + pk["2"]*z^2
  plot.fun(z, hz)
  title("Critical (m = 1), \n 1 root")
  points(1,1)
```

  We can prove by answering: 
  What is $h'(1)$? What is $h(0)$? Is $h''(z) > 0$? 



```{r,  fig.height = 4}
  pk = c(.3, .0, .7); names(pk) <- 0:2
  z = seq(0, 1.6, .01)
  hz = pk["0"]  + pk["1"]*z + pk["2"]*z^2
  plot.fun(z,hz)
``` 
  
  Where is $h(p_0)$, $h(h(p_0))$, $h(h(h(p_0)))$, $\ldots$?


So how do we actually get $d$?

  Take the case where $p_0 = .3$, $p_1 = 0$, and $p_3 = .7$ (the one I
  just plotted).
  
  - Can do some algebra \pause
  - Or we can recursively iterate on the computer.
  
Numerical recursion

```{r}
  pk = c(.3, .0, .7); names(pk) <- 0:2 ## our example
  d <- pk["0"] # initial value
  for (i in 1:20)
  {
      d <- pk["0"]  + pk["1"]*d + pk["2"]*d^2
      if (i %in% c(1,2,19,20))
          print(paste(i, d))
  }
```

Did we get the right value?
  
```{r,  fig.height = 4}
  pk = c(.3, .0, .7); names(pk) <- 0:2
  z = seq(0, 1.6, .01)
  hz = pk["0"]  + pk["1"]*z + pk["2"]*z^2
  plot.fun(z,hz)
  abline(h = d, col = "green")
  abline(v = d, col = "green")
```

Extinction and non-extinction revisited

- If $m > 1$, there exists $d$ bigger than 0 and less than unity.
- This means there's some positive chance of extinction.
- But also some chance of never-extinction. (What form does
      never-extinction take?)

```{r, fig.height = 5}
    suppressWarnings(matplot(t(Z.mat), log = "y", type = "l", lty = 1, ylab = "Zn", xlab = "n"))
```

Relevance to Corona virus?

<div class="column-left">
*Good*

- Unrestricted growth (frontier, new disease, start of a reaction)

- A "null" model for understanding how apparent structure
is just random outcomes. Families that die out didn't have to
have low $NRR$. Just because most new viruses don't break out,
doesn't mean they aren't potentially dangerous ($R_0 >> 1.0$).

- When offspring of 1 depends on offspring of other  (e.g., brothers inheriting a farm)

- When resource constraints slow growth rates (e.g.,

## Means of offspring in generation $n$

  - Is it "meaningful"? (If we have a lot of zeros)
  - We'll show that unconditional mean
    $$
    \mathbb{E} Z_n = m^n
    $$
  - What if $m = 1$?
  
size of surviving lines?

  Total probability is sum of conditional probabilities, times the chance of
  each condition:
  $$
  \mathbb{E} Z_n = \mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n > 0) P(Z_n > 0) +
  \mathbb{E}( Z_n | Z_n = 0) P(Z_n = 0)
  $$
  
  What is mean size of surviving lines?

  - Hint 1: $P(Z_n = 0) = d_n$
  - Hint 2:     $\mathbb{E} Z_n = m^n$

  
Let's check our result using simulation

Our set-up

```{r} 
  branch <- function(n_max = 30, p_k = c(p0, p1, p2), Z1 = 1)
  {
      ## note: this returns 0s when extinct
      k <- 0:(length(p_k)-1)
      Z.vec <- rep(NA, n_max)
      Z.vec[1] <- Z1
      for (i in 1:(n_max-1))
      {
          Z.vec[i+1] <- sum(sample(x = k,
                                   size = Z.vec[i],
                                   replace = T,
                                   prob = p_k))
      }
      return(Z.vec)
  }
  p0 = .3; p1 = .4; p2 = .3 ## what is m?

Proving     $\mathbb{E} Z_n = m^n$

Ingredients

- $h'(1) = m = \bar{Z}$
- $h_n'(1) = \bar{Z}_n$
- $h_{n+1}(z) = h(h_n(z))$

Derivation


Variance result.  (Too much algebra to do here). 
  
  For $m = 1$,
  $$
  \sigma_n^2 = n \sigma^2 
  $$

  - Also a result for $m\neq 1$
  - What does increasing variance mean for critical case? (Does
    this make sense?)
  - What happens to variance of lines that survive? Is it bigger
    or smaller than unconditional variance?

Variance in our simulation

n <- 1:ncol(Z.mat)
plot(n, var_Zn)
```

Distribution of $Z_n$
```{r, fig.height = 5}
   Z20 <- table(table(Z.mat[,20]))
   Z5 <- table(table(Z.mat[,5]))
   par(mfrow = c(2,2))
   plot(Z20[Z20 < 100])
   plot(log(Z20[Z20 < 100]))
   plot(Z5[Z5 < 100])
   plot(log(Z5[Z5 < 100]))
```


## Geometric offspring distribution

  For $k = 1, 2, \ldots$,
  $$
  p_k = b c^{k-1}
  $$

  For $k = 0$,
  $$
  p_0 = 1 - p_1 - p_2 - \ldots .
  $$

  Let's solve for $p_0$, using the geometric series sum, for $a <
  1$,  
  $$
  1 + a + a^2 + \ldots =
  1 / (1-a)
  $$


A picture, Lotka's parameters for 1920
```{r, fig.height = 4}
b = 0.2126 ;   c = 0.5893
kk = 1:10  ;   p_kk = b * c^(kk-1)
p0 = b/(1-c)
k = c(0, kk) ;   p_k = c(p0, p_kk)
plot(k, p_k)
```

Realism?

  See Table 10.3, p 386, Grinstead and Snell.



### The Geometric Distribution's simple PGF

  
  $$
  h(z) = p_0 + p_1 z + p_2 z^2 + \ldots
  $$
  With geometric $p_k$
  $$
  h(z) = p_0 + \sum_{k= 1}^\infty b c^{k-1} z^k.
  $$
  Substituting for $p_0$ and rewriting
  $$
  h(z) = \left( 1 - {b / (1-c)}\right) + bz \sum_{k= 1}^\infty 
  (cz)^{k-1}.
  $$
  Substituting $j = k-1$,
  $$
  h(z) = \left( 1 - {b / (1-c)}\right) + bz \sum_{j= 0}^\infty 
  (cz)^{j} = \left( 1 - {b / (1-c)}\right) + {bz \over (1 - cz)}
  $$

  The PGF is now ``tractable''

$m$ and extinction

  $$
  h(z) =  \left( 1 - {b / 1-c}\right) + {bz \over 1 - cz}
  $$

  Please solve for $m$. (Hint: $h'(1)$). What is $m$ with Lotka's $b$
  and $c$?
  
  We solve $z = h(z)$ with a bunch of algebra to get
  $$
  d = {1 - b - c \over c(1-c)}
  $$

  How does $d$ depend on $b$ and $c$?

Applications

  We have exponential distribution with a few  very large lines, and a
  lot of small lines.
  
  - Distribution of neutral alleles
  - Distribution of family lines (Y-chromosome, mtDNA, last names)
  
Our result
  With geometric $p_k$, we get geometric $Z_n$, for all $n$.
